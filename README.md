# Structure-Specification

Updating functions/files regularly

I) Files

	NB : It is possible to make a stack with different types, however it is not necessarily recommended, 
	     the objective being to have the most homogeneous and free library.

	Structuration_date.h : Structure for all files

	Stack.h - Stack.c : File gathering a stack structure with several useful and fast functions. 
			    The characteristics of the battery are correctly respected and as homogeneous 
			    as possible.
